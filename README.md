## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone the repo locally**

    from the command line
    ```sh
    #to create your parent directory
    $ mkdir projects
    $ cd projects
    $ git clone git@github.com:mkezmkez/todo-list-vanhack.git
    $ cd todo-list-vanhack
    ```

2.  **Installs**

    Make sure you are in todo-list-vanhack folder, and you have yarn and npm installed in your system

    
    ```sh
    #To install all the dependencies and npm modules
    $ yarn install
    ```
    
    
    ```sh
    To run the app locally    
    $ yarn start
    ```
    
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`! Open your browser and go to localhost:3000 to see it live, it will reload when you make changes
    

3.  **Git**
    - The code is in GitHub, in this repository https://github.com/mkezmkez/todo-list-vanhack
    - The default branch is ```development```, the production branch is ```main ```. All features were developed in different branches (e.g.  ```feature/styles``` which were kept for version control.
    - You may find he commit hitory here https://github.com/mkezmkez/todo-list-vanhack/commits/development

4.  **Disclaimers**
    - I decided to go for a minimalistic style with some hints of colors keeping the color palette consistent
    - The API keys are published on the repository intentionally for your convenience. The API keys were restricted for https://localhost:3000 and https://vanhack-bdc0a.web.app/
    - There are known minor bugs in the app, I was unable to fix them due to time constrains, hence they are in the roadmap
    - The code is not optimally organized. I wish I had more time to apply the DRY principle
    - State was kept on the server for data persistance across browsers / sessions

5.  **Roadmap**
    - TO-DOS
      - Fix UNCOMPLETE ALL
      - Add case-insensitive search
      - Add a RESET button to reload all TODOS fter completing a query
      - Refactor code
      - Reorganize code to apply DRY
      - End to end testing
      - Restyle the GO button
    - ENABLE CHANGE USER BUTTON
    - ENABLE GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION FOR SESSION KEEPING
    - ADD ORDER DESCENDING AND ASCENDING FEATURE
    - ADD SNOOZE BUTTON TO MOVE TASKS TO THE END OF THE LIST
    - MAKE LOGO CLICKABLE WITH A LINK TO /INDEX
    - FILTER BY COMPLETED / DELETED / UPCOMING
    - TEST FOR ACCESSIBILITY
    - ADD HOVER TAGS FOR ICONS TO REVEAL THEIR FUNCTIONALITY
