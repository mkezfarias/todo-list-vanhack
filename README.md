## üöÄ Quick start

    ```

2.  **Installs**

    Make sure you are in todo-list-vanhack folder, and you have yarn and npm installed in your system

    
    ```sh

    ```sh
    #To run the app locally    
    $ yarn start
    ```

3.  **Git**
    - The code is in GitHub, in this repository https://github.com/mkezmkez/todo-list-vanhack

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers
  - The design might look plain. I decided to go for a minimalistic style with some hints of colors keeping the color palette consistent
  - The database rules are set to test mode (unsecured) intentionally and will be open until Jun 9th 2021
  - The API keys are published on the repository intentionally for your convenience. 
  - The API keys were restricted for the following domins
    https://localhost:3000 
    https://vanhack-bdc0a.web.app/
  - There are known minor bugs in the app, I was unable to fix them due to time constrains, hence they are in the roadmap
  - The code is not optimally organized. I wish I had more time to apply the DRY principle
  - State was kept on the server for data persistance across browsers / sessions
  - console.log() functions were left intentionally for testing purpuses
<br>
