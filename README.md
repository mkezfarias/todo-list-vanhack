## üíª Live version

  You can see the deployed version of the web app on the following domain

  https://vanhack-bdc0a.web.app/
  
<br>

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Clone the repo locally from the command line**
    ```sh
    #to create your parent directory
    $ mkdir projects
    $ cd projects
    $ git clone git@github.com:mkezmkez/todo-list-vanhack.git
    $ cd todo-list-vanhack
    ```

2.  **Installs**

    Make sure you are in todo-list-vanhack folder, and you have YARN and NPM installed in your system

    
    ```sh
    #To install all the dependencies and npm modules
    $ yarn install
    ```
    
    
    ```sh
    #To run the app locally    
    $ yarn start
    ```
    
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`! Open your browser and go to localhost:3000 to see it live, it will reload when you make changes
    
3.  **Git**
    - The code is in GitHub, in this repository https://github.com/mkezmkez/todo-list-vanhack
    - The default branch is ```development```, the production branch is ```master```. I developed the project in different branches following gitflow.  (e.g.  ```feature/styles``` which I kept for demonstration purpuses.
    - You may find the commit history here. https://github.com/mkezmkez/todo-list-vanhack/commits/development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers
  - The design might look plain. I decided to take a risk and go for a minimalistic style with some hints of colors, and some neuphormism
  - I removed the text from the buttons in the hope that they would be self-explanatory. Furthermore, I intend to add a hover box with descriptions
  - The database rules are set to test mode (unsecured) intentionally and will be open until Jun 9th, 2021
  - The API keys are public on the repository intentionally for your convenience. 
  - The API keys are restricted to receive requests from the following domains only.  https://localhost:3000 and  https://vanhack-bdc0a.web.app/
  - There are known minor bugs in the app, I was unable to fix them due to time constraints, hence they are in the roadmap
  - The code is not organized in an optimal way. I would have applied the DRY principle had I had more time for the assignment
  - State is kept on the server for data persistence across browsers/devices
  - console.log() functions were left intentionally for testing purposes
  
<br>



## üöô Roadmap
  - TO-DOS
    - Fix "Mark uncompleted (all)"
    - Add case-insensitive search
    - Restyle the GO button
    - Paginate search results
    - End-to-end testing
    - Remove console.log() functions and unused variables
    - Refactor code
    - Reorganize code to apply DRY
  - ADD HOVER TAGS FOR ICONS TO REVEAL THEIR FUNCTIONALITY
  - ENABLE GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION FOR SESSION KEEPING
  - ADD ORDER DESCENDING AND ASCENDING FEATURE
  - ADD SNOOZE BUTTON TO MOVE TASKS TO THE END OF THE LIST
  - FILTER BY COMPLETED / DELETED / UPCOMING
